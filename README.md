## How to Host a Resume on a  Static Website & The Value of Technical Writing

### **Purpose**
This README will serve to teach you the basics of modern technical writing. It will also explain how to utilize fundamental tools and walk you through the process of formatting your resume on a hosted website. This README will also make heavy reference to Andrew Etter's book *Modern Technical Writing*, as it is a great reference for current Technical Writing practices. Through the explanations given hopefully you will have gained an understanding of current technical writing practices.

### Hosting a Resume - Requirements
The software stack which we will use is as follows (explanations to follow):
  
> Lightweight markup language: **Markdown**
	  
> Markdown Editor: **Ghostwriter**  
  
> Static Site Host: **GitHub Pages**  
  
> Static Site Generator: **Jekyll**

#### What are these anyway?
- A lightweight markup language is the cornerstone of modern technical writing. It offers a simplistic and highly readable layout. Depending on the language you choose, it can also have many built in formatting options. The most popular one is Markdown - you can find a tutorial on how to use it under the '*More Resources*' section below
- To write and edit your Markdown (.md) file with ease, we will also be using the Markdown editor Ghostwriter. It provides a sleek interface where you can immediately see the formatted output as you write
- A static site is any website which lacks non-static components. These websites are often used for documentation, and do not require a database or any dependencies. GitHub Pages will provide the means to host your website.
- To easily create a static website, we will be using the static website generator (or SSG) Jekyll. An SSG provides resources to generate static websites, such as pre-existing themes which can be seamlessly applied. Jekyll was chosen due to its integration with GitHub Pages, making it easy to work with
